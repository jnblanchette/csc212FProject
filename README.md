this will be our readme file to show various aspects including the steps needed for the compiler in order for the professor to run this code. 
// work in progress

// will need the 3 file setup. maybe more. the b-tree.cpp, main.cpp b-tree.h
// will need at least a constructor function, insert, traverse, search, and others. 

//In computer science, a B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. The B-tree generalizes the binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more than two children.[2] Unlike other self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as databases and file systems.

//According to Knuth's definition, a B-tree of order m is a tree which satisfies the following properties:[7]

Every node has at most m children.
Every internal node except the root has at least ⌈m/2⌉ children.
Every non-leaf node has at least two children.
All leaves appear on the same level and carry no information.
A non-leaf node with k children contains k−1 keys.
